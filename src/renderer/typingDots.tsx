/**
 * Discord's typing dots (the chat's "is typing" line, avatars in the DM and member lists, thread
 * rows) are three SVG circles whose radius and opacity react-spring rewrites every frame, forever,
 * while Discord is focused. Each frame restyles and relayouts the page: four indicators kept the
 * main thread ~900ms/s busy in a 7000-element page. The same dots as HTML in a foreignObject,
 * animated with CSS scale and opacity, run on the compositor: ~1ms/s.
 *
 * Only the dots move to CSS. The spring that slides them in from the middle and fades them in and
 * out still runs, it's short. Same size, color, spacing and timing as Discord's; like Discord's,
 * they stand still while it isn't focused, and like Discord's own CSS dots, reduced motion slows them.
