/**
 * Asks the user directly, from main, before something only they should be able to allow.

 * Plugins run in Discord's page next to Evi's own UI, so anything the page says ("the user agreed")
 * could come from a plugin. For the few actions that matter (installing a plugin with full access to
 * the computer, deleting a folder the store didn't make, badge admin actions) main shows its own
 * system dialog, which no page code can click or skip.
 *
 * Tests set EVI_TEST_CONFIRM: "yes" or "no" answers every question, "page" trusts what the page asked
 * for (the Electron test drives the store from the page). Plugins can't set main's environment.
