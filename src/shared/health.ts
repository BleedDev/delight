/**
 * Live plugin health: which store plugins are known to be broken right now.
 *
 * Installs report a plugin when it can't find parts of Discord, its patches fail or it doesn't start
 * (POST /v1/health/reports: the plugin, its version, Discord's build and the kind of problem, nothing
 * else). Enough installs reporting the same version marks it broken automatically; its author or an
 * admin can also set a status with a message ("Fix coming in 1.0.2"), which always wins.
 * GET /v1/health is the store-wide picture the app shows on store cards and the Plugins list.
