/**
 * The kill switch: plugins an admin pulled because they're malicious or badly broken. A pulled plugin
 * is turned off on every install, not just taken out of the store, and the user is told why.
 *
 * Pulls ride along in GET /v1/health as `pulled`, so every install already fetching health gets them.
 * Main keeps the last answer on disk and hands it to the renderer at boot (BootData.pulled), so a
 * pulled plugin never starts, even offline. Pulling a version leaves the setting that turned the
 * plugin on alone: when the pull is lifted, or a newer version that isn't pulled is installed, it
 * runs again.
