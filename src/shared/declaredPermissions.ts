/**
 * What a plugin says it needs, in its manifest's `permissions`, and the rules Evi holds it to:
 *
 *     "permissions": { "network": ["api.example.com"], "readMessages": true }
 *
 *   network         sites it contacts from Discord's page, Discord's own included. A host covers its
 *                   subdomains ("discordapp.com" covers cdn.discordapp.com)
 *   readMessages    reads messages: message events, Discord's message stores, the Flux dispatcher
 *   sendMessages    sends messages: slash commands that post text, Discord's message endpoints
 *   changeSettings  changes settings: Discord's account and settings endpoints, Evi's badge settings
 *
 * Anything left out is false (or no sites), so `"permissions": {}` asks for nothing. A plugin without
 * `permissions` at all is from before Evi 0.7.0 (or doesn't say): it isn't held to anything, and the
 * store and its details say so.
 *
 * Where it's enforced (src/renderer/plugins/guard.ts): only in what Evi hands the plugin. Its fetch,
 * XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket and EventSource, its context (ctx.flux, ctx.hook, ctx.command...) and its
 * own copy of @evi/api. Plugins share one JavaScript realm with Discord, so code that reaches Discord's
 * objects another way (window.fetch, a finder by props, a source patch) can still go further; that's
 * why store plugins are still reviewed. A plugin's full-access part (native.js) isn't limited at all.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no network, no disk, shared by main, the renderer, the server and the tests.
